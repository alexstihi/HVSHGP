# Hierarchical Variational Sparse Gaussian Porcess (HVSHGP)

This is a repository for Hierarchical Variational Sparse Gaussian Porcesses (HVSHGP), implemented from scratch using GPflow and TensorFlow.

* Please install the `gp_package` using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).
* For now, only the Variational Sparse Heteroscedastic GP model is made available.
* The hierarchical extension to follow soon.
